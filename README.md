Key Insights

Tailor Swift has the most streams on Spotify with a total stream of 11.9 billion streams 
with her hit song "Shape of You “having the highest stream
The artist named Bad Bunny ranks the highest on Deezer Charts history with the number 
55 followed by Tailor Swift at number 53 on the Deezer Charts

highest charting song on Spotify history for the year 2023
The song titled "Last Last" is the highest charting song on the history of Apple Chart
The total streams on Spotify between the year 1930 to 2023 is 383 billion streams
 As at the early 90's streaming platforms where not a thing, I was not until the early 2000's 
that streaming platforms began to come up and artists started ranking their song and 
consumers/listeners could stream songs they like online without necessarily purchasing the 
songs.
Patterns or Anomalies
Most of the songs charting really high are RnB songs like the songs by artists like; Tailor Swift, 
The Weekend, SZA etc.

 Methods:
Data exploration using visualization charts
Analyzing the number of streams by the songs charting on Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music 
streaming platforms.

Recommendations

Streaming platforms are used by consumers to listen to songs and artists they like, these 
streaming platforms generate revenue from these engagements on their platform hence, I 
recommend making it easy for consumers to stream songs on Spotify without necessarily 
needing a subscription profile before streaming a song.
 I also recommend that artists should also benefit from these streams where they can be paid 
by the number of streams an artist is able to garner
 These dataset was from within the period of 1930 to 2023, Majority of the songs listed are 
new songs hence I recommend a review; either to put in the old songs that where listened 
to in the 90’s or simply remove and limit the dataset to the early 2000’s
This analysis is now complete.
